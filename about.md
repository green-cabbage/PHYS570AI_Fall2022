## Policies
General Course Policies
- E-mail policy: I will do my best to answer e-mail in a timely fashion. I do not
mind trying to answer any course question using e-mail but you have to be
specific and precise in your writing.
- Late arrival/early departure: I understand that there are often conflicts
and you may either be late or have to leave early. Be courteous, we are in a big lecture room so just be courteous to your classmates by leaving or arriving quietly.
- Cell phones/computers: Please turn off the volume on computers and cell phones during lecture.
- Class participation: Be prepared to participate in the classroom by answering questions if asked or helping to work problems in groups.

## Academic Dishonesty
Any effort to represent somebody else’s work as your own, or allowing your work to represented as somebody else’s, is cheating.
Working with another student on your homework is not cheating and, in fact, is encouraged. In the event that you work with other students on homework assignments it is your responsibility to hand in your own work. Copying the work from another student is cheating. Likewise, having somebody else solve assigned problems for you is cheating.
If a student is found cheating, he or she will receive an F for the course and be reported to the Dean of Students. In serious cases the Dean may suspend or expel the student from the university.
Purdue prohibits "dishonesty in connection with any University activity. Cheating, plagiarism, or knowingly furnishing false information to the University are examples of dishonesty." [Part 5, Section III-B-2-a, University Regulations] Furthermore, the University Senate has stipulated that "the commitment of acts of cheating, lying, and deceit in any of their diverse forms (such as the use of substitutes for taking examinations, the use of illegal cribs, plagiarism, and copying during examinations) is dishonest and must not be tolerated. Moreover, knowingly to aid and abet, directly or indirectly, other parties in committing dishonest acts is in itself dishonest." [University Senate Document 72-18, December 15, 1972]

## Attendance
Purdue University policy is that student participation is expected in every regularly scheduled class. There are nevertheless instances when an absence is justified. The Purdue University Student Handbook describes the procedures for these eventualities. An excerpt is quoted below.
Students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. Only the instructor can excuse a student from a course requirement or responsibility. When conflicts or absences can be anticipated, such as for many University sponsored activities and religious observations, the student should inform the instructor of the situation as far in advance as possible...For unanticipated or emergency absences when advance notification to an instructor is not possible, the student should contact the instructor as soon as possible by email, or by contacting the main office that offers the course. When the student is unable to make direct contact with the instructor and is unable to leave word with the instructor’s department because of circumstances beyond the student’s control, and in cases of bereavement, the student or the student’s representative should contact the Office of the Dean of Students,
The Purdue University for absence can be found at

## Grief Absence Policy for Students
Purdue University recognizes that a time of bereavement is very difficult for a student. The University therefore provides the following rights to students facing the loss of a family member through the Grief Absence Policy for Students (GAPS). GAPS Policy: Students will be excused for funeral leave and given the opportunity to earn equivalent credit and to demonstrate evidence of meeting the learning outcomes for misses assignments or assessments in the event of the death of a member of the student’s family.
Missed or Late Work
Students are expected to complete assignments by the due date. Homework can only be handed in late pending approval of the instructor. Homework not handed in will be given a grade of zero.
The mid-term examinations and final examination must be taken. Students are expected to take these examinations at the scheduled times. Failure to take tests will result in a score of zero for that examination. In the event of allowable absence, as determined by Purdue University policy, a make-up examination will be given as soon as possible after the examination time. Failure to make-up an examination will result in an incomplete score for the course.
Missed quizzes cannot be taken later. In the event that the absence is allowed an excused absence grade will be given. This grade is the average of the student’s quiz grades. To receive an excused absence grade for a quiz the student must notify the instructor in writing either before the absence or within a week of the absence.
## Violent Behavior Policy.
Purdue University is committed to providing a safe and secure campus environment for members of the university community. Purdue strives to create an educational environment for students and a work environment for employees that promote educational and career goals. Violent Behavior impedes such goals. Therefore, Violent Behavior is prohibited in or on any University Facility or while participating in any university activity.

Students with Disabilities.
Purdue University is required to respond to the needs of the students with disabilities as outlined in both the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 through the provision of auxiliary aids and services that allow a student with a disability to fully access and participate in the programs, services, and activities at Purdue University.
If you have a disability that requires special academic accommodation, please make an appointment to speak with me within the first three (3) weeks of the semester in order to discuss any adjustments. It is important that we talk about this at the beginning of the semester. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Disability Resource Center (http://www.purdue.edu/drc) of an impairment/condition that may require accommodations and/or classroom modifications.
## Emergencies
In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines and grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised semester calendar or other circumstances beyond the instructor’s control. Relevant changes to this course will be posted onto the course website or can be obtained by contacting the instructors or TAs via email or phone. You are expected to read your @purdue.edu email on a frequent basis.
## Nondiscrimination
Purdue University is committed to maintaining a community which recognizes and values the inherent worth and dignity of every person; fosters tolerance, sensitivity, understanding, and mutual respect among its members; and encourages each individual to strive to reach his or her own potential. In pursuit of its goal of academic excellence, the University seeks to develop and nurture diversity. The University believes that diversity among its many members strengthens the institution, stimulates creativity, promotes the exchange of ideas, and enriches campus life.
Purdue University prohibits discrimination against any member of the University community on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation, disability, or status as a veteran.
